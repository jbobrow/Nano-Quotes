[Nano Quotes | Daily Inspiration](https://jbobrow.github.io/Nano-Quotes/)


At Nanotronics, I begin each morning entering Building 20, where I’m greeted by a mechanical display board, reminiscent of one found in an old train station. This digital display board is populated with quotes that have been shared with the Nanotronics family since I joined the company in 2023. These quotes were selected by Paul Henrique, Security Manager for Building 20. I hope these quotes provide inspiration for you, just like they have for me—day in, day out.

## How it was made
I had the idea to make a tribute to Paul and his gift to Nanotronics over the year. I had been saving a CSV (spreadsheet) of quotes that he had shared, amassing a collection of more than 700, and had a feeling I would find a good use for them some day. Realizing this single page website was _easy_ beacause of open source software. Almost all of the credit belongs to the creator of Flapper, credited below.
